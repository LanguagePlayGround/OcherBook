clean up object model:
    LibraryActivity
        nav buttons - impl as Widgets; fade disabled
    BatteryIcon should be a Icon
font search path
make UI scalable to other res
    make SDL window resizable
font size does not always pop correctly
Show/hide SystemBar causes page to shift
improve startup time:  don't parse so much to get metadata
flag in Meta what hasn't been discovered yet (expensive to create icon, ...)
persist shelf
    json vs Flattenable
widget
    pop up menus
    packing
    make dirty rects more granular (eg, hiding SystemBar doesn't reflow entire page)
g_fb->bbox vs m_rect

do settings apply before or after layout?
    better definition around what AttrSizeAbs, etc mean
    are absolute font sizes really absolute while in the layout?
settings:
    date format
    user's name

fonts
    layout by line, to do centering
    justify:  full, right
    FE: build some higher-level abstractions
    font path, scan ttf files, font families, ...
    font preferences

remove exceptions from File
clean up Path/File to be simpler, more posix-like

first-run routine:
    select language
