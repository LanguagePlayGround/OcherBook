 *  MurmurHash2, public domain by Austin Appleby
 *  @sa http://murmurhash.googlepages.com
 *
 *  Requirements when selecting a hash:
 *   - Fast
 *     (murmur is 10% faster than jenkins lookup3; 5x faster than SHA1)
 *   - Small code size; prefer no lookup tables
 *     (murmur can be as small as 52 bytes)
 *   - Excellent distribution, since may be "hashing" a single 4-byte pointer
 *     (http://murmurhash.googlepages.com/avalanche)
 *  Non-requirements:
 *   - Deterministic results across different platforms
