make UI scalable to other res
    make SDL window resizable
font size does not always pop correctly
Show/hide SystemBar causes page to shift

improve startup time:  don't parse so much to get metadata
flag in Meta what hasn't been discovered yet (expensive to create icon, ...)
persist shelf
    json vs Flattenable
no database; deal with books coming and going dynamically (NFS support!)

pop up menus
widget
    packing
    make dirty rects more granular (eg, hiding SystemBar doesn't reflow entire page)
g_fb->bbox vs m_rect

do settings apply before or after layout?
    better definition around what AttrSizeAbs, etc mean
    are absolute font sizes really absolute while in the layout?
settings:
    date format
    user's name

fonts
    layout by line, to do centering
    justify:  full, right
    FE: build some higher-level abstractions
    font path, scan ttf files, font families, ...
    font preferences

remove exceptions from File
clean up Path/File to be simpler, more posix-like
