Technology is hard to push back against.  Books are/will be moving to electronic.
But what problems does that pose?
    - privacy
    - control
    - accessibility
    - reliability



Privacy:
    - All local, no cloud
    - Open source
    - No tracking / cloud / FB integration / etc

Control:
    - All local, no cloud
    - no DRM
    - Ability to import / export your reading record / notes / etc

Accessibility:
    - All local, no cloud
    - multiple architectures
    - multiple output devices
    - low resource requirements / low power
    - support new and old tech

Reliability:
    - books do not crash or hang



How do we enjoy e-books without creating a new dark age?  (Consider DRM,
technological obsolescence, peak oil, ...)
    - discourage DRM
    - support low power (Raspberry Pi?)
    - support old tech
    - archiving is still the user's problem...
